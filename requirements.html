            <h2>Requirements</h2>
            <p>Requirements are a fundamental aspect of DO-178C. They define what the software is intended to do and provide the basis for verification and validation activities.</p>
            <p>DO-178C distinguishes between different types of requirements, including:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>High-level requirements: These requirements describe the overall functionality of the system.</li>
                <li>Low-level requirements: These requirements describe the detailed design and implementation of the software.</li>
                <li>Safety requirements: These requirements address potential hazards and ensure the safety of the system.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>It is essential to write clear, concise, and verifiable requirements. Requirements should be unambiguous and should be testable to ensure that they have been met.</p>
