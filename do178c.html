            <h2>DO-178C</h2>
            <p>DO-178C, also known as Radio Technical Commission for Aeronautics (RTCA) DO-178C, is a standard for software development in airborne systems. It is the primary standard used by the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) and other aviation regulatory agencies to approve software-based systems for use in aircraft.</p>
            <p>DO-178C provides guidance for the development of safety-critical airborne systems. It covers all aspects of the software development lifecycle, including requirements management, design, coding, testing, and configuration management.</p>
            <p>The main objective of DO-178C is to ensure that software used in airborne systems is safe and reliable. To achieve this objective, DO-178C defines a set of objectives that must be met for each software level. The software level is determined by the criticality of the software function. The higher the criticality, the more stringent the objectives.</p>
            <p>DO-178C is a complex and comprehensive standard. It is essential for anyone involved in the development of software for airborne systems to have a thorough understanding of DO-178C.</p>
