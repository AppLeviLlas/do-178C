            <h2>System Safety</h2>
            <p>System safety is a critical aspect of DO-178C. It involves identifying and mitigating hazards that could lead to accidents or incidents.</p>
            <p>The system safety process includes the following activities:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Hazard analysis: Identifying potential hazards that could lead to accidents or incidents.</li>
                <li>Risk assessment: Assessing the likelihood and severity of each hazard.</li>
                <li>Safety requirements: Developing requirements to mitigate the identified hazards.</li>
                <li>Verification: Verifying that the safety requirements have been met.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>System safety is an iterative process. The activities are performed throughout the software development lifecycle, and the results of each activity are used to improve the safety of the system.</p>
