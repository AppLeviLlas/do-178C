            <h2>Development Assurance</h2>
            <p>Development assurance is a key aspect of DO-178C. It encompasses all activities undertaken to ensure that the software meets its intended requirements and is safe and reliable.</p>
            <p>The development assurance process includes the following activities:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Requirements management: Ensuring that the requirements are complete, consistent, and verifiable.</li>
                <li>Design: Developing a software design that meets the requirements and is safe and reliable.</li>
                <li>Coding: Implementing the software design in a programming language.</li>
                <li>Testing: Verifying that the software meets its requirements and is safe and reliable.</li>
                <li>Configuration management: Managing the software configuration to ensure that changes are controlled and that the software can be rebuilt if necessary.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Development assurance is an iterative process. The activities are performed throughout the software development lifecycle, and the results of each activity are used to improve the software.</p>
