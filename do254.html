            <h2>DO-254</h2>
            <p>DO-254, also known as Radio Technical Commission for Aeronautics (RTCA) DO-254, is a standard for the development of airborne electronic hardware. It is used in conjunction with DO-178C to ensure the safety and reliability of airborne systems.</p>
            <p>DO-254 provides guidance for the development of complex electronic hardware, such as field-programmable gate arrays (FPGAs) and application-specific integrated circuits (ASICs). It covers all aspects of the hardware development lifecycle, including requirements management, design, implementation, verification, and validation.</p>
            <p>The main objective of DO-254 is to ensure that electronic hardware used in airborne systems is safe and reliable. To achieve this objective, DO-254 defines a set of objectives that must be met for each hardware level. The hardware level is determined by the criticality of the hardware function. The higher the criticality, the more stringent the objectives.</p>
            <p>DO-254 is a complex and comprehensive standard. It is essential for anyone involved in the development of electronic hardware for airborne systems to have a thorough understanding of DO-254.</p>
